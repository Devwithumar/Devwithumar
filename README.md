# Ahmad Umar

**Backend AI Engineer · Data Analytics & Machine Learning**

I design and build production-grade backend systems with a focus on AI, data pipelines, Automation workflows and applied machine learning. My work prioritizes correctness, scalability, and clean architecture over hype.

---

## What I Do

* Build **AI-powered backend services** (APIs, RAG pipelines, N8N, model-serving layers)
* Design **data analytics workflows** for insight, reporting, and decision support
* Develop and deploy **machine learning systems** with real-world constraints
* Write maintainable, well-documented code meant for long-term ownership

---

## Core Stack

* **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, Express.js, PHP
* **Backend:** FastAPI, REST APIs, async services
* **Data & ML:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, LLM tooling
* **Frontend (when needed):** React
* **Dev & Ops:** Git, Docker, CI/CD

---

## Experience Highlights

* Backend and AI engineering on real-world applications
* Production-focused approach to model integration (LLMs, NLP, analytics)
* Strong emphasis on system design, documentation, and reliability

---

## Current Focus

* Backend architecture for AI systems
* Machine learning in production environments
* LLM-based tools (RAG, N8N automations, system architure, prompt engineering, evaluation)
* Shipping maintainable, well-tested software
* Applied machine learning system design
* Model training, evaluation, and iteration
* Feature engineering and data pipelines

ML inference optimization and deployment

---

## Principles

* Clarity over cleverness
* Systems > scripts
* Production first
